Angular 2
=========

Angular 2 typically leverages [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org/) to compile to ES5.  Thank you to Anand at [https://medium.com/angular-2-with-es6/angular-2-with-es6-the-5-minute-quickstart-a9e4eb0bffcc](https://medium.com/angular-2-with-es6/angular-2-with-es6-the-5-minute-quickstart-a9e4eb0bffcc) for a sample of doing this in ES6 instead.
