Introduction to ES6: the language and the tools
===============================================

Welcome to the ES6 Workshop.  We'll look at the ES6 workflow, leveraging Webpack and Babel to transpile our EcmaScript v. 6 / 2015 code into EcmaScript v. 5 code that runs in modern browsers.


Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure you have [npm](https://npmjs.org/) v. 3.x, and if not, install / update [Node](https://nodejs.org) to v. 5 or 6.


Topics
------

We'll follow the numbered folders in this repo.  Some are slides or demos we'll walk through together, some are self-directed projects you'll get to dig into.  As an overall theme, think how you can apply this to your work product or personal project.

Make yourself a folder, and as you master each topic, add the features to your personal folder.  When you're done, you'll have an app framework that you can easily plug business logic into to form the app you need.
