Bit.LY/12keysjs

12 Keys - 
1. JS belongs in a js file
	No inline JS
		inline is not cached
		inline not reusable
		adds noise to the page	
		can't leverage external tools ( lint, etc)
2. All js should be static
	Don't build js dynamically on the server
	violates seperation of concerns
	need dynamic behavior? - use JSON
	JS configutation object pattern
		for the app , make a c# object with app name, that contains all vars that could be needed
		then serialize that to a page as json.  All objects needed on are js and doesn't need dynamic JS
3. JS should be minified
	why? removal
		comments
		validations
		hot reloading
		dead code elimination / tree shaking
4. JS should be linted
	ESLint is the hotness
	linting avoids mistakes
5. JS should have automated tests
	(Jasmine, Mocha, AVA ) 
	hardest part -  choosing how
		browser, node, frameworks, etc
		Mocha & Expect & Cheerio & jsdom( on NPM ) - using in this class
		Cheerio - uses jquery 
		jsdom - in mem dom to simulate browser
		Framework specfic test libs
	where to put the test files
		 central or along
		 central - internal
		 alongside - easy imports, easily visible, convienent to open, no need to create folder structure, easy file moves
	tests should run on save
	Risk - Peltzman Effect  - safety measures cause us to take more risks
6.JS should be encapsualted.
	no global js
	all js should be namespaced
	IIFE, Recealing Module, AMD, CommonJS, ES6 ( ES6 & CommonJS are most popular)
7. Dependencies should be explicit
8. JS should be transpiledd
	Babel - Classes, Modules, Constants, arrow function ( lambdas ), Let, iterators, promises, template
	other options (TS, Elm)
9. JS should have an automated build
	Gulp
	Grunt
	Broccoli
	NPM
10. Use Libraries
11. Seperate Concerns
12. you need a starter kit
